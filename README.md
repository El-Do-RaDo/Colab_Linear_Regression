# Colab_Linear_Regression

Linear regression is perhaps one of the most well known and well understood algorithms in statistics and machine learning.

Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. If only one independent variable is used weâ€™re talking about a simple linear regression.

Linear regression is an approach to modeling the relationship between the dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables denoted X.

For example, in a simple regression problem (a single x and a single y), the form of the model would be: y = B0 + B1*x
